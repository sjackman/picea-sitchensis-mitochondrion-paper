# Abstract

Plant mitochondrial genomes vary widely in size. Although many plant mitochondrial genomes have been sequenced and assembled, the vast majority are of angiosperm, and few are of gymnosperm. Most plant mitochondrial genomes are smaller than a megabase, with a few notable exceptions. We have sequenced and assembled the largest complete mitochondrial genome of a gymnosperm, Sitka Spruce (*Picea sitchensis*). We sequenced the whole genome using Oxford Nanopore MinION and identified contigs of mitochondrial origin assembled from these long reads. The assembly graph shows a multipartite genome structure, composed of one smaller 168 kbp circular segment of DNA, and a larger 5.4 Mbp component with a branching structure. The branching points of the assembly graph may represent active sites of recombination and give insight into an underlying complex linear branching physical genome structure.

# Methods

## Genome sequencing and assembly

Genomic DNA was extracted from young needles. Using 18 Oxford Nanopore MinION flow cells, we sequenced 98 Gbp in 9.6 million reads of whole genome sequencing, which yields 5 fold depth of the roughly 20 Gbp nuclear genome and 26 fold depth of coverage of the mitochondrial genome. Separating putative mitochondrial reads by homology to known mitochondrial sequences could discard mitochondrial sequences that are unique Sitka spruce. We instead chose to first assemble the whole genome reads and then compare contigs to known mitochondrial sequences. Assembling such a large number of Nanopore reads is not yet straight forward, and so we adopted an iterative approach to assembly. We first obtained a rough but computationally efficient assembly using Miniasm [@Li_2016], after trimming adapter sequences with Porechop [@Wick_2017_Porechop]. Miniasm produces an assembly whose sequencing error rate is comparable to that of the original reads, but no better. We polished this assembly using Racon [@Vaser_2017]. We selected contigs with homology to the white spruce (*Picea glauca* isolate PG29) mitochondrial genome [@Jackman_2015] using Bandage [@Wick_2015], retaining contigs with at least one 5 kbp alignment to the white spruce mitochondrion by BLASTN [@Altschul_1997]. This selection process would also discard any mitochondrial plasmids smaller than 5 kbp.

We select putative mitochondrial reads by aligning the Nanopore reads to this assembly using Minimap2 [@Li_2018] and retaining reads with an alignment score of 5000 or more. We assembled these reads using Unicycler [@Wick_2017_Unicycler]. This assembly yielded one circular contig and many linear contigs with no adjacent contigs, indicating that the assembly is not yet complete. We repeated the alignment of the Nanopore reads to the assembly and again retained reads with an alignment score of 5000 or more. We assembled these reads using Flye [@Kolmogorov_2018], taking the assembly graph `2-repeat/graph_final.gfa`, which identifies repeats that are longer than the read length and determines their precise boundaries. This Flye assembly was polished using Racon. Contigs with homology to the white spruce mitochondrion (alignment length at least 5000 and percent identity at least 90) were selected using Bandage. Contigs with unambiguous adjacent contigs were merged using the Bandage operation "Merge all possible nodes".

Nanopore reads have difficulty accurately determining the length of homopolymer repeats. We polished the assembly using one flow cell of Illumina HiSeq sequencing reads of the same DNA extraction, yielding 59 fold depth of coverage of the mitochondrion, to correct homopolymer errors. We used Unicycler Polish to iteratively align the reads to the assembly using Bowtie2 [@Langmead_2012] and correct the consensus sequence using Pilon [@Walker_2014]. Ten rounds of polishing yielded no further corrections on the tenth round. Unicycler Polish applies Assembly Likelihood Estimate (ALE) [@Clark_2013] to each round to verify that the assembly of the final round of polishing most resembles the reads.
