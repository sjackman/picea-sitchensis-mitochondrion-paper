# Abstract

Plant mitochondrial genomes vary widely in size. Although many plant mitochondrial genomes have been sequenced and assembled, the vast majority are of angiosperm, and few are of gymnosperm. Most plant mitochondrial genomes are smaller than a megabase, with a few notable exceptions. We have sequenced and assembled the 5.5 Mbp mitochondrial genome of Sitka spruce (*Picea sitchensis*), the largest complete mitochondrial genome of a gymnosperm. We sequenced the whole genome using Oxford Nanopore MinION and identified contigs of mitochondrial origin assembled from these long reads. The assembly graph shows a multipartite genome structure, composed of one smaller 168 kbp circular segment of DNA, and a larger 5.4 Mbp component with a branching structure. The branching points of the assembly graph may represent active sites of recombination and give insight into an underlying complex linear branching physical genome structure.

# Introduction

Annotating plant mitochondrial genomes is made difficult by numerous features of plant mitochondria that are not typical of most organisms. RNA editing of C-to-U is pervasive and creates AUG start codons by editing ACG to AUG and can also create stop codons in a similar fashion [@Hiesel_1989]. An alternative GUG start codon is used by some genes [@Sakamoto_1997], which may be created by RNA editing of a GCG codon. The typical GU-AG splice site expected by most splice-aware alignments tools is instead GUGCG-AY (Y denotes C or T) for group II introns [@Lambowitz_2010]. Trans-spliced genes are common in mitochondrial genomes [@Kamikawa_2016], and no purpose-built software tool exists for identifying and annotating trans-spliced genes. To add further difficulty, trans-spliced exons may be as small as 22 bp, as is *nad5* exon 3 of gymnosperm [@Guo_2016]. For these reasons, annotating a plant mitochondrial genome remains a laborious and manual task.

# Methods

## Genome sequencing and assembly

Genomic DNA was extracted from young needles. Using 18 Oxford Nanopore MinION flow cells, we sequenced 98 Gbp in 9.6 million reads of whole genome sequencing, which yields 5 fold depth of the roughly 20 Gbp nuclear genome and 26 fold depth of coverage of the mitochondrial genome. Separating putative mitochondrial reads by homology to known mitochondrial sequences could discard mitochondrial sequences that are unique Sitka spruce. We instead chose to first assemble the whole genome reads and then compare contigs to known mitochondrial sequences. Assembling such a large number of Nanopore reads is not yet straight forward, and so we adopted an iterative approach to assembly. We first obtained a rough but computationally efficient assembly using Miniasm [@Li_2016], after trimming adapter sequences with Porechop [@Wick_2017_Porechop]. Miniasm produces an assembly whose sequencing error rate is comparable to that of the original reads, but no better. We polished this assembly using Racon [@Vaser_2017]. We selected contigs with homology to the white spruce (*Picea glauca* isolate PG29) mitochondrial genome [@Jackman_2015] using Bandage [@Wick_2015], retaining contigs with at least one 5 kbp alignment to the white spruce mitochondrion by BLASTN [@Altschul_1990]. This selection process would also discard any mitochondrial plasmids smaller than 5 kbp.

We select putative mitochondrial reads by aligning the Nanopore reads to this assembly using Minimap2 [@Li_2018] and retaining reads with an alignment score of 5000 or more. We assembled these reads using Unicycler [@Wick_2017_Unicycler]. This assembly yielded one circular contig and many linear contigs with no adjacent contigs, indicating that the assembly is not yet complete. We repeated the alignment of the Nanopore reads to the assembly and again retained reads with an alignment score of 5000 or more. We assembled these reads using Flye [@Kolmogorov_2018], taking the assembly graph `2-repeat/graph_final.gfa`, which identifies repeats that are longer than the read length and determines their precise boundaries. This Flye assembly was polished using Racon. Contigs with homology to the white spruce mitochondrion (alignment length at least 5000 and percent identity at least 90) were selected using Bandage. Contigs with unambiguous adjacent contigs were merged using the Bandage operation "Merge all possible nodes".

Nanopore reads have difficulty accurately determining the length of homopolymer repeats. We polished the assembly using one flow cell of Illumina HiSeq sequencing reads of the same DNA extraction, yielding 59 fold depth of coverage of the mitochondrion, to correct homopolymer errors. We used Unicycler Polish to iteratively align the reads to the assembly using Bowtie2 [@Langmead_2012] and correct the consensus sequence using Pilon [@Walker_2014]. Ten rounds of polishing yielded no further corrections on the tenth round. Unicycler Polish applies Assembly Likelihood Estimate (ALE) [@Clark_2013] to each round to verify that the assembly of the final round of polishing most resembles the reads.

## Annotation

We annotated coding genes and non-coding rRNA and tRNA genes using automated methods where possible, and manual inspection to refine these automated annotations. We used Prokka [@Seemann_2014], which uses Prodigal [@Hyatt_2010], to identify single-exon coding genes and open reading frames (ORFs). We used MAKER [@Holt_2011], which uses BLASTP and Exonerate [@Slater_2005], to identify cis-spliced coding genes. We used tRNAscan-SE [@Lowe_1997] and Aragorn [@Laslett_2004] to identify tRNA. We used RNAmmer [@Lagesen_2007] and Barrnap [@Seemann_2014] to identify rRNA. We used RNAweasel [@Lang_2007] to identify domain V of group II introns.

Following automated annotation, we reviewed coding genes for completeness, compared to their best BLASTP match and corrected the annotation, most often for aspects that are particular to plant mitochondria. We manually corrected the annotation of genes to address start codons created by RNA editing ACG to the start codon AUG and editing GCG to the alternative start codon GUG (see results for details). Three genes use atypical start codons: *rpl16* uses a GUG start codon [@Sakamoto_1997]; *rps19* uses a GUG start codon created by RNA editing GCG, seen also in *Pinus strobus* AJP33554.1; *matR* appears to use an unusual GGG start codon, seen also in *Cycas taitungensis* YP_001661429.1 [@Chaw_2008] and *Pinus strobus* AJP33535.1. Then gene *sdh4* was missed by automatic annotation, as its coding sequence was found to overlap on the same strand that of *cox3* by 73 bp.

We reviewed splice sites and adjusted their position to agree with the expected splicing motifs of group II introns when possible, ensuring not to introduce insertions or deletions into the peptide sequence compared to homologous proteins. We confirmed the presence of domain V of the group II intron upstream of the 3' splice site, identified by RNAweasel. We manually annotated trans-spliced introns by comparing alignments of homologous proteins to the genome. We determined the 5' and 3' splice sites similarly to cis-spliced introns, looking for expected group II splicing motifs, and domain V upstream of the 3' splice site.

# Results

## Genome assembly

The mitochondrial genome of Sitka spruce is 5.52 Mbp assembled in 13 segments, with 44.7% GC content. The genome assembly is composed of two components: a 168 kbp circular segment, and a larger 5.36 Mbp component composed of 12 segments, visualized by Bandage [@Wick_2015] in @fig:genome. The two smallest segments have an estimated copy number of 2 based on their depth of sequencing coverage, and all other segments have similar depth of coverage. The single-copy segments range in size from 84 kbp to 1.65 Mbp. The two repeat segments are 24 kbp and 27 kbp. No sequence variation is evident in these repeats. An absence of variation in the repeat implies that they may be involved in active recombination. Though 10% of reads are larger than 24 kbp, no reads fully span these repeats.

![The assembly graph of the mitochondrial genome of Sitka spruce. Each segment is labeled with its size and named 01 through 13 by rank of size.](figures/genome.png){#fig:genome}

The genome is composed of 1.7% (93 kbp) of genes with known function, 9.5% (524 kbp) of 2,499 ORFs (at least 90 bp), 3.7% (205 kbp) of repeats, and 85.1% anonymous sequence. Of the ORFs, 468 are at least 300 bp (100 amino acids) in size and compose 3.6% (202 kbp) of the genome. The nuclear repeat LTR/Gypsy compose 51% of the repeat sequence, LTR/Copia compose 7%, simple repeat sequence compose 34%, low complexity compose 3%, and 5% other repeat sequences. Plastid-derived sequence compose 0.25% (14 kbp) in 24 segments.

## Genes

The mitochondrial genome of Sitka spruce has 41 distinct protein coding genes with known function, 3 distinct rRNA genes, 27 distinct tRNA genes representing 18 distinct anticodons. The 41 protein coding genes are those seen in the gymnosperm mitochondria *Cycas taitungensis* [@Chaw_2008] and *Ginkgo biloba* [@Guo_2016]. 27 introns are found in 10 protein coding genes, 14 cis-spliced and 13 trans-spliced, shown in @tbl:introns. One additional intron is found in a plastid-derived tRNA gene, bringing the total count to 28 introns.

Sitka has all three rRNA genes. The 5S rRNA gene *rrn5* is present in four copies. The small subunit rRNA gene *rrn18* is present in three copies, though one copy is found on the 27 kbp repeat segment with an estimated copy number of two, yielding a total copy number of four. One copy of the large subunit rRNA gene *rrn26* is present, though it is found on the 24 kbp repeat segment, which has an estimated copy number of two.

Sitka has 27 tRNA genes, representing 18 distinct anticodons, coding for 14 distinct amino acids, DEHKLMNPQRTVWY. *trnM-CAU* has seven copies, *trnD-GUC* three copies, and *trnY-GUA* two copies. All other tRNA genes are single copy. The *trnG-UUU*, *trnM-CAU*, and *trnV-UAC* genes are derived from plastid origins. One cis-spliced intron is observed in the plastid-derived *trnV-UAC* gene.

In addition to three plastid-derived tRNA genes, eight partial plastid genes are found in the 14 kbp of plastid-derived sequence: *atpE*, *chlN*, *petA*, *psaA*, the intron of *rpl2*, *rps3*, *rrn18*, and a partial *trnS-GGA* gene with homology to *Cycas taitungensis*.

## Introns

Although the same 26 introns are found in the same 10 genes as *Cycas taitungensis* [@Chaw_2008, @Guo_2016], eight introns that are cis-spliced in *Cycas* are trans-spliced in Sitka spruce, more than doubling the number of trans-spliced introns found in *Cycas*. Half of the introns in Sitka are trans-spliced. All introns are group II introns, and domain V was identified by RNAweasel [@Lang_2007], with one exception.

The first intron of *nad1*, which is trans-spliced in Sitka and other gymnosperm [@Guo_2016], has no domain V detectable by RNAweasel. The genomic disruption of this intron may occur in domain V itself, as is seen in *cox2* of *Diphylleia rotans* [@Kamikawa_2016], possibly fractured twice as is *nad1* intron 4 of *Welwitschia mirabilis* [@Guo_2016]. Alternatively, RNA editing may be preventing its detection by RNAweasel.

The fourth intron of *nad1* is cis-spliced and contains *matR* in *Cycas*, trans-spliced with a single disruption in Sitka, and trans-spliced with two distinct genomic disruptions in *Welwitschia mirabilis* [Figure S2 of @Guo_2016]. Whereas *matR* is found in a cis-spliced intron in *Cycas* and free-standing in *Welwitschia*, it is found upstream of *nad1* exon 5 in Sitka. In this regard, Sitka appears to be an evolutionary midpoint found between *Cycas* and *Welwitschia*. Sitka however has not experienced the extensive gene loss observed in *Welwitschia*.

A second partial copy of *nad5* is found in Sitka with one cis-spliced group II intron, representing exons 4 and 5. This translated protein sequence of this partial gene is more similar however to eudicots (99% identical to both *Chrysobalanus icaco* and *Hirtella racemosa* and >95% identical to many others) than to the complete *nad5* of Sitka (76% identical) and may have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer, as is frequently reported in plant mitochondria [@Richardson_2006] of both gymnosperm [@Won_2003] and angiosperm [@Bergthorsson_2003], although this interpretation has been questioned in *Vitis vinifera* [@Goremykin_2008]. This partial *nad5* is also found in white spruce (*Picea glauca*) [@Jackman_2015] with 100% identity.

RNAweasel identifies 34 group II domain V regions in Sitka, 26 of which are associated with a cis- or trans-spliced introns in coding gene, and one of which is in the intron of the plastid-derived tRNA *trnV-UAC*. One domain V is derived from the intron of the plastid *rpl2* gene. The remaining six domain V are not associated with a gene. Further investigation would be needed to determine whether these hits are partial fragments of introns or false positives.

Table: 27 introns are seen in ten protein coding genes, 14 cis-spliced and 13 trans-spliced. One cis-spliced intron is seen in a plastid-derived tRNA. \*An additional partial copy of *nad5* has one cis-spliced intron. {#tbl:introns}
